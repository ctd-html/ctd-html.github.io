            <p>Megan is independent designer who has built websites for companies like dappered, various UChicago schools, and the bridge avenue school. 
Megan, you taught us the importance of having a passion for what you do. If we don't truly care about what we build, then we will never achieve as much as we could've.</p>

            <p>Jack Auses is the lead developer for making the University of Chicago site. When Mr. Auses came to our class to speak, we did a comparison of the old University of Chicago site and the new one (that he pretty much created). I remember Mr. Auses saying that he did most of the work. I can speak for my class in saying that the new U of C site is amazing! I think Mr. Auses' profession is a great one and he must have fun every day. I think it was cool that Sandy invited one of his old co-workers to come in and talk to us. We also included some nice quotes about Jack and Megan that the class spoke about in their journals. </p>

                I have lived in Naperville, Illinois up till now. I am moving to Chicago. In my life, I have played many sports, but I enjoy tennis the most. I am the first person in my entire family to be born in the US. My birthday is April 30, 1998 (If anyone is a basketball fan, I have the same birthday as Isaiah Thomas). I love video games, and movies, and I am a huge sports fan. <br>
