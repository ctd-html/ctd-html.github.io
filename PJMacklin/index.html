                I liked the speaker today a lot, and the process of using grids. <br>

                The speaker was interesting and it was awesome to see his project. This class has made me truly appreciate how much work and effort is needed to be put into such a large project like that. <br>

                PJ Macklin is a designer that currently works for a company called SoundSlice. SoundSlice is a service that allows people to take music and add tabs and other things to create virtual music sheets viewable on their website. Other users can then go in and look these sheets up and watch them as the song plays, creating a very new and innovative way to learn music.

                When he came to talk to us, he discussed this project and about designing a website and the process he goes through. PJ had always loved music and eventually, he and a few friends of his came up with the idea for this website. PJ was in charge of the front-end part and left the other part to his coworkers. While speaking with us, he also discussed the use of a grid, and how useful it was when designing a site.
