                Nick is an interactive designer from Chicago. He wrote a short book on what he does called <i>Cadence and Slang</i>. Interactive design focuses on a products usability. How easily can a person find what they're looking for, what are they trying to click, and what's most popular are variables an interactive designer will pay attention to. They will then modify the website to move links they feel are more prominent where the most people are clicking and hide away links that aren't popular.
