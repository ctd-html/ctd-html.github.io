            <p>Jason Kunesh, who has been employed by organizations including the Chicago Field Museum, Microsoft, Groupon, IBM, and more, is a design professional who in his own words can generally "be found at the intersection of people and technology.</p>
            <p>In coming to speak to us, Jason emphasized the importance of building technology with the user in mind. As Director of User Experience of Obama for America, Jason described the though process that went into planning technology in a way that optimized the user experience. As students, this advice in particular is invaluable as we naturally try to create elegant products but sometimes fail to remember the importance of the user.</p>
